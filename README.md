# hello-world
When I was young, I started telling myself my own bedtime stories, which was fine with my parents because I think they were running out.  My favorites were the autobiographical ones;  I would tell stories about my life in the future.

Usually I would be an engineer traveling the world solving engineering challenges as I went from town to town.  So, more or less what I do these days in managing outsourced manufacturing.

I live in San Diego, and spend about half of my time traveling. You can always get in touch with me at mikediliberto@gmail.com or using the wechat link below

It should go without saying, but I will say it anyway: the opinions on this site are solely my own, and do not reflect the opinion of my clients, vendors, or employers.
